# CPRG251 [![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/asoula21/cprg251/badge?s=670b2daf0ba298a6b71cab3f2f39307970d2ccd9)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/asoula21/cprg251)
Central repository for all CPRG251 assignments.

## Developing projects

Please make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- A desktop platform with [Java 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) installed.
- When working with the codebase, IDEs such as [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) are recommended.

### Downloading the source code

Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://asoula21@github.com/CPRG251
cd CPRG251
```

To update the source code to the latest commit, run the following command inside any assignment directory:

```shell
git pull
```

### Building

For Eclipse, building a project is the same as usual. For IntelliJ, we use the Gradle toolchain to build and compile java projects.

### Contributing

Please open a pull request for any new changes. Forking this repository is highly recommended instead as it makes it easier to track changes.
Avoid commiting changes to the master branch in your fork. Instead, create a new branch:
```shell
git checkout -b branch-name
```

When creating new branches in your fork, please use descriptive names.
