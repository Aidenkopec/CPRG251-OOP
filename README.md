Central repository for all CPRG251 assignments.

## Developing projects

Please make sure you have the following prerequisites:

- A desktop platform with [Java 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) installed.
- When working with the codebase, IDEs such as [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/) or [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/) are recommended.


### Building

For Eclipse, building a project is the same as usual. For IntelliJ, we use the Gradle toolchain to build and compile java projects.
